Word Rate
=========

This is a small Wordpress plugin that allows you to define per word rates for authors, and display calculated costs of articles in your post list and in the post's editor page. Currently word rates are only visible to administrators and editors.

Installation
------------

Download the repo and unzip the archive into your /wp-content/plugins folder and activate the plugin. You'll see a new panel under Users and the word rate per article in your posts list and in a meta box on the post editor page.

Todo
----

* Allow flat rate for articles as well as word rate
* Add default word rate for new authors
